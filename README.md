# StreamingSite

## Overview
StreamingSite is a user-friendly website that allows users to stream movies for free using the VidSrc API. The site aims to replicate the experience of most free streaming sites, providing a vast selection of movies to choose from. Users will be able to access and stream movies based on IMDB or TMDB data.

## Features
- List and stream movies for free using the VidSrc API.
- Utilize IMDB or TMDB data to retrieve movie information.
- Allow users to save their progress while streaming movies.
- Implement a user database to enhance user experience and provide personalized features.

## Technologies Used
The project will require both front-end and server-side technologies. The main components include:

### Front-end Technologies
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating the user interface and interactive elements.
- JavaScript libraries or frameworks like React or Vue.js for building dynamic components.
- Fetch API or Axios for making API requests to retrieve movie data.

### Server-side Technologies
- Node.js or Python for server-side scripting.
- Express.js (Node.js) or Flask (Python) for building the server.
- Database management system (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) for storing user data and movie information.

## APIs
The project will rely on two main APIs:

1. VidSrc API: Used for fetching the list of latest movies and streaming URLs.
2. IMDB or TMDB API: Used to retrieve movie details such as title, plot, cast, and other relevant information.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies for both the front-end and server-side components.
3. Set up the database to store user data, if required.
4. Configure the API endpoints and integrate them with the front-end components.
5. Start the development server and test the application locally.
